# How It Works

The Smart-Brain API operates as follows:

1. **Receiving Image URLs**: The API receives image URLs from the frontend of the Face Recognition Brain application as users submit them for face detection.

2. **Face Recognition Processing**: Upon receiving an image URL, the API employs its sophisticated face recognition algorithms to analyze the image and identify faces within it.

3. **Data Delivery to Frontend**: Once the face recognition process is complete, the API sends the results back to the frontend, allowing the Face Recognition Brain application to display the detected faces and other relevant information.

4. **Real-Time and Responsive**: Thanks to its efficient design, the Smart-Brain API ensures real-time and responsive face detection, providing users with an immersive and delightful experience.
